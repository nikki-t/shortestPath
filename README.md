# shortestPath

Finds the shortest path in a graph from a user-defined start node to a destination node using two different algorithms.

## Description

Implemented two heuristic algorithms that attempt to determine the shortest path
from a start node to a destination node in a graph. The project uses object-oriented programming to
provide a structure to the objects that interact in a graph traversal dictated by each algorithm. Data
structures were chosen to maximize this efficiency and to meet the needs of each algorithm as well as to
provide convenient storage of the graph.
